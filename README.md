<!-- Brief Introduction -->
## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
Hey! I’m a Computer Engineering student currently studying at UBC Vancouver, where I dive deep into the nuts and bolts of both hardware and software. I have a knack for solving complex problems and am particularly passionate about developing scalable systems. My journey through the maze of coding and development has been marked by the numerous projects I’ve embarked on - from the challenging to the intriguing. Whether it’s wrangling with low-level programming in C or ARM Assembly or exploring the creative boundaries of front-end development, I’ve had the oppurtunity to push my limits and expand my horizons. As I continue the closing phase of my academic journey, I’m always on the lookout for the next exciting project to tackle.

## 📚 Projects
While the academic guidelines restrict me from showcasing all my projects, I’ve tackled a variety of interesting challenges such as:
- Implementing synchronization mechanisms for OS161 in C,
- Crafting a TCP protocol simulation over UDP in C,
- Developing a distance vector routing algorithm/simulation in Python,
- And building a virtual memory system using multi-level page tables and swap pages in C.

These projects have sharpened my skills and allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical, often complex scenarios. Stay tuned for more public repositories as I continue to translate these experiences into shareable formats!
