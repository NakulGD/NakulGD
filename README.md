<!-- Brief Introduction -->
## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
Hey! I‚Äôm a Computer Engineering student currently studying at UBC Vancouver, where I dive deep into the nuts and bolts of both hardware and software. I have a knack for solving complex problems and am particularly passionate about developing scalable systems. My journey through the maze of coding and development has been marked by the myriad projects I‚Äôve embarked on - from the challenging to the intriguing. Whether it‚Äôs wrangling with synchronization mechanisms in operating systems, simulating distance vector routing algorithms, or even reinventing TCP using UDP for fun, I‚Äôve had my hands in many pies. And while my academic endeavors keep me on my toes, I‚Äôm always on the lookout for the next exciting project to tackle.

<!-- Projects Section -->
## üìö Projects
While the academic guidelines restrict me from showcasing all my projects, I‚Äôve tackled a variety of interesting challenges such as:
- Implementing synchronization mechanisms for OS161 in C,
- Crafting a TCP protocol simulation over UDP in C,
- Developing a distance vector routing algorithm/simulation in Python,
- And building a virtual memory system using multi-level page tables and swap pages in C.

These projects have sharpened my skills and allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical, often complex scenarios. Stay tuned for more public repositories as I continue to translate these experiences into shareable formats!
